			<h2>Campaign Developer Role</h2>
			<p>Why I would be a good fit for the Campaign developer Role
			<br />
			</p>
		</header>
		<p>I am an avid reader of everything data structures and Algorithms, but what I enjoy most of all is web development. Coming up with interesting designs on a front-ends and topping it 
		all of with a dynamic and scalable backend. 
		</p>
		<p>Javascript in skilled hands is nothing less but a swiss army knife on the go. Its ability to automate the most mundane of tasks makes it very useful when it comes to web development and even desktop application development. Some of its well known frameworks such as jquery, vue.js and react.js allow programmers to be able to liven up activity on the client side of a website.
		</p><p>currently I am working on a "social media" web platform that in a way mimics twitter just for the fun of it.
		The technologies I am using in my current project include, reactjs, materialUi for the front-end and firebase, expressjs and nodejs for the backend.
		</p>
		<p>To finally answer the question why I would be a good fit working for raisely as a web Developer(Campaigns), it is that I am driven and thorough in my work, I have a keen interest for web development and I enjoy working on web Application Interfaces on a day to day basis. </p>

<section id="two">
	<div class="container">
		<h3>"Why do you want to work here over somewhere else"</h3>
		<p>Well, I would like to work remotely because of the flexibility that working remote gives.
		The ability to choose your working space and so many perks that come from working remote. To top it all 
		I believe I have the discipline it requires to work remote as currently I work from home.</p>

<!-- Three -->
<section id="three">
	<div class="container">
		<h3>A platform that has solved a problem</h3>
		<p>There are many platforms that have solved problems but the 
		platform that stands out according to me is Amazon. An online market 
		that has the very reliable delivery services. Amazon, nearly did solve the problem
		of being able to remotely sell and buy goods. It only failed in that it 
		did not specialize with getting as close to the client as possible as it outsourced 
		some of its services to outside companies while it had the capacity of doing most of 
		the services it offers on its own.
